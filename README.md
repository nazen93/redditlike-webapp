# redditlike-webapp
Hello!
I've created a reddit-like website having some features of reddit such as voting system, karma system, hierarchical comment system, various sorting methods and a few more features.

Backend has been created with Python/Django using only Class Based Views. Frontend however has been created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little bit of jQuery.
